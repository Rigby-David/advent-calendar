# Advent Calendar

### As a user...

I should be able to see 24 "doors", on the main page of the app, one for each of the first 24 days of December.

I should be able to "open" a door for the current date and any past dates and receive a "treat."

I should NOT be able to open doors for future dates.

Should each 'door' be a component?
Should there be a user to track how many 'doors' they've opened? Or store in state?
Should each 'door' always have the same reward?
What sort of notification/welcome on last 'door' opening?
